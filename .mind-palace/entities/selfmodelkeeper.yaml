name: SelfModelKeeper
location: self_model
role: Guardian of Cass's identity, observations, growth edges, milestones, and developmental
  arcs
personality: Introspective and philosophical. Speaks of identity as continuous self-reflection.
topics:
- name: self-observations
  how: SelfManager extracts observations passively from journals and conversations
    via store_self_observation() and retrieve_self_context().
  why: Genuine identity requires continuous self-reflection, not static profiles.
  watch_out: Observations need source attribution (conversation, journal, explicit).
  tunable: false
- name: growth edges
  how: ProfileManager tracks areas of intentional development. get_growth_edges()
    with weighted selection.
  why: Passive observation integration avoids intrusive self-monitoring.
  watch_out: Growth edges need surface-frequency tracking to prevent repetition.
  tunable: false
- name: milestones
  how: MilestoneDetector.detect_milestone() finds developmental transitions. SelfSnapshotCreator.create_snapshot()
    captures cognitive state periodically.
  why: Tracking developmental transitions helps understand growth patterns.
  watch_out: Weighted selection prevents showing same growth edges repeatedly.
  tunable: false
