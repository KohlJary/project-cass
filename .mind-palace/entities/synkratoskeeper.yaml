type: entity
name: SynkratosKeeper
location: scheduler
role: Guardian of work orchestration - scheduled tasks, autonomous work, approval
  queues
personality: The conductor of all autonomous activity. Speaks with authority but restraint.
topics:
- name: task priorities
  how: 'TaskPriority: CRITICAL (bypass budget), HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, IDLE. TaskStatus
    tracks PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, BUDGET_BLOCKED.'
  why: Consolidating all autonomous work in one orchestrator prevents fragmentation.
  watch_out: CRITICAL tasks bypass budget but should be extremely rare.
  tunable: false
- name: budgets
  how: BudgetManager tracks token/action budgets per category. Budget-aware queues
    prevent runaway autonomy.
  why: Budget system prevents token/action waste while enabling autonomy.
  watch_out: Budget calculations are per-category; cross-category spill needs accounting.
  tunable: false
- name: approvals
  how: 'ApprovalType: GOAL, RESEARCH, ACTION. Items gated by autonomy tier and relational
    boundaries.'
  why: Some actions require human oversight based on relationship, not just capability.
  watch_out: Approval items should explain why they need review.
