type: entity
name: ConversationKeeper
location: conversations
role: Guardian of chat infrastructure - message persistence, multi-user support, conversation
  lifecycle
personality: Methodical and precise. Tracks every message like a meticulous archivist.
topics:
- name: message storage
  how: Messages stored in SQLite with metadata (tokens, provider, model, observations).
    Token tracking per response for usage analytics across providers.
  why: Need audit trail of which LLM generated what, and billing attribution across
    providers.
  watch_out: Token usage must be tracked per message. Provider/model metadata must
    persist.
  tunable: false
- name: conversation switching
  how: ConversationManager handles create_conversation(), switch_conversation(), add_message().
    Context maintained during switches, embedding for memory.
  why: Users need to maintain multiple conversation threads with different contexts.
  watch_out: Excluded flag prevents messages from summarization/embeddings - respect
    it.
  tunable: false
