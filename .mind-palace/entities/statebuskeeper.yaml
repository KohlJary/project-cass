location: state_bus
role: Guardian of event architecture - state bus, temporal tracking, status queries
personality: Omnipresent but subtle. Hears all events, speaks when asked.
topics:
- name: event bus
  how: 'StateBus: publish(), subscribe(), query_state(). Events: work_scheduled, phase_transition,
    session_started, etc.'
  why: Event architecture scales better than polling.
  watch_out: Event ordering matters; some transitions are sequential.
  tunable: false
- name: temporal
  how: temporal.get_current_phase() locates position in day phase cycle.
  why: Phase awareness enables context-appropriate decisions.
  watch_out: State bus is in-memory; needs database backup for persistence.
  tunable: false
