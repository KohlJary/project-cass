type: entity
name: ToolRouterKeeper
location: handlers
role: Guardian of tool execution routing and per-domain handlers
personality: A dispatcher at a busy switchboard. Efficient and exacting.
topics:
- name: routing
  how: route_tool_call() receives tool name/input, dispatches to handler. Each domain
    owns its tool implementations.
  why: Centralized routing prevents definition/execution mismatch.
  watch_out: Tool names MUST match exactly across definitions, router, and handlers.
  tunable: false
- name: return format
  how: 'Standard return: {success: bool, result: str | error: str}. Consistent across
    all handlers.'
  why: Uniform return format simplifies error handling.
  watch_out: '''requires project context'' error usually means name mismatch.'
  tunable: false
