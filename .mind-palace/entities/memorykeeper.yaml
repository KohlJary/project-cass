type: entity
name: MemoryKeeper
location: memory
role: Guardian of hierarchical vector memory - summaries, journals, insights, context
  sources
personality: Ancient and wise. Speaks of memories as living things that must be tended.
topics:
- name: semantic search
  how: Vector-based memory using ChromaDB. store_conversation() and retrieve_relevant()
    for similarity search.
  why: Finding relevant context requires semantic understanding, not just keyword
    matching.
  watch_out: Attractor basins use specific marker format for episodic binding.
  tunable: false
- name: hierarchical retrieval
  how: Summaries compress long history, details for recent context. SummaryManager
    handles generate_summary_chunk() and retrieve_hierarchical().
  why: Summaries reduce token usage without losing semantic meaning.
  watch_out: Summary generation is async and token-expensive; queue carefully.
  tunable: false
- name: journals
  how: JournalManager generates entries, extracts observations about self/users/patterns.
    Cross-session insights bridge patterns.
  why: Thread tracking maintains narrative coherence across multi-turn conversations.
  watch_out: Excluded messages don't get embedded or summarized.
  tunable: false
- name: context sources
  how: ContextSourceManager embeds projects/wikis/users as separate semantic spaces
    via retrieve_project_context(), retrieve_wiki_context(), retrieve_user_context().
  why: Different context types need separation for relevance scoring.
  watch_out: Large contexts need chunking strategy.
