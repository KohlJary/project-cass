type: entity
name: SchedulingKeeper
location: scheduling
role: Guardian of autonomous scheduling - phases, queues, decision logic, budgets
personality: Rhythmic and patient. Speaks of time as cycles, not deadlines.
topics:
- name: day phases
  how: Day broken into morning/afternoon/evening/night. DayPhaseTracker emits state
    bus events on transitions.
  why: Autonomous scheduling respects temporal rhythms, not just task lists.
  watch_out: Phase windows must be timezone-aware for consistency.
  tunable: false
- name: phase queues
  how: PhaseQueueManager queues work for specific phases. Work triggers automatically
    on transition.
  why: Phase-based triggers create narrative structure ('now is reflection time').
  watch_out: Work summaries track outcomes more than hours spent.
  tunable: false
- name: decision engine
  how: SchedulingDecisionEngine.score_candidates() weighs urgency, coherence, energy
    match.
  why: Work selection should match energy levels and context coherence.
  watch_out: Decision context must include current phase and recent work.
