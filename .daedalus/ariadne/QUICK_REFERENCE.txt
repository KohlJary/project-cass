  Architecture: /home/jaryk/cass/cass-vessel/.daedalus/theseus/reports/2025-12-24-autonomous-scheduler-architecture.md

SPEC:
  Actions: /home/jaryk/cass/cass-vessel/spec/atomic-actions-projection.md

MONITORING COMMANDS:
  Watch logs:    journalctl -u cass-vessel -f | grep -i 'autonomous\|phase\|work'
  Check status:  curl http://localhost:8000/admin/scheduler/status | jq
  Check budget:  curl http://localhost:8000/admin/scheduler/budget | jq
  Check history: curl http://localhost:8000/admin/scheduler/work-history | jq
  Restart:       sudo systemctl restart cass-vessel

WORK SEQUENCE:
  Phase 1: WP1 (1.5 hrs) → WP2 (1.0 hrs)  [Gate: Service starts]
  Phase 2: WP3 (1.5 hrs) + WP4 (2.5 hrs)  [Gate: Actions validated]
  Phase 3: WP5 (1.5 hrs)                   [Gate: System operational]

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
  HYDRA:   Templates route to deprecated runner_key stub (WP1)
  SPIDER:  Scheduler never started (WP2)
  CERBERUS: Action definitions missing (WP4)

EXPECTED TIMELINE:
  WP1+2:    2.5 hours  → Service starts
  WP3+4:    2.5 hours  → Actions validated (parallel)
  WP5:      1.5 hours  → System operational
  TOTAL:    8-10 hours → Autonomous scheduler ready

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
  ✓ Service starts without errors
  ✓ Autonomous scheduling logs appear
  ✓ At least one work unit executes
  ✓ Budget tracking is accurate
  ✓ No "Unknown action" errors
  ✓ Work summaries saved and queryable

STATUS: Ready for dispatch to Daedalus
CONFIDENCE: HIGH (LOW risk, LOW complexity)
