## Overnight 2026-10-20 → 21: the stabilization plan, built

Kohl asked for the stabilization plan to be implemented by morning. Every piece was its own PR, reviewed by Momus, green on CI, then merged. None of it is deployed: the service has been running since Oct 17, so **nothing below is live until a restart**. No migration touched live data. Each one was dry-run on a copy of the 2026-10-20 snapshot.

| PR | What landed | Behaviour change on restart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #81 | Cheap cuts (#54): dead calendars, work planning, readers of tables nothing writes | None (dead code) |
| #82 | One agent loop (#70), behind the `agent_loop` lever (off) | None while off; chat entry points signal "conversation arrived" |
| #83 | PeopleDex (#55): every writer of user knowledge goes to PeopleDex; relational context scoped per daemon; fixes #31 | **Her prompt:** up to 5 "general" observations about a person now appear |
| #84 | Journals (#56): one generator, SQLite source of truth, Chroma index; schema v60 | Journals now also land in SQLite; nightly reindex of unindexed rows |
| #86 | Model routing (#64): all 78 non-chat LLM call sites go through `llm_config`, one usage ledger, Model Routing admin page; schema v61; fixes #29, #52 | **None by design:** same models, same budget gate, dreams pinned |
| #87 | Heartbeat core (#62), behind the `heartbeat` lever (off), with a scheduler inventory; schema v63 | None while off |
| #88 | One auth system (#61): one SQLite store, one token format with roles; old tokens still verify; schema v62 | Logins accept both of an account's old passwords until you choose |
| #89 | Chat no longer blocks the event loop during memory retrieval (#85); `/conversations/new` creates for the caller; `cass_chat.py` fixed | Discord/HA/scheduler keep running while she thinks |
| #91 | 12 loose ends (#22, #26, #27, #42, #43, #45, #46, #48–#51, #79) | Discord wake replies run tools; locked journals can't be deleted (423) |
| #90 | Research (#60): one queue and one runner, a model per step; schema v64 | None by design: same search backends per path |

Also tonight: the daily backup timer is live (`cass-backup.timer`, 04:30, 7 daily + 4 weekly, `~/cass/backups`). The HearthWeave Drunk Greg harness merged (HearthWeave #8).

## Waiting on Kohl

Data (each has a dry-run script; nothing has run against live data):
1. **PeopleDex migration:** `scripts/migrate_legacy_users_to_peopledex.py --apply`. On the snapshot it adds 19 observations and 8 shared moments; a second run adds 0.
2. **Journal backfill:** `scripts/backfill_journals_sqlite.py --apply`, run with the service stopped (it opens Chroma). It copies 1,547 Chroma journals into SQLite: 20 daily, 894 research, 20 spell, 613 untyped. The 10 seed rows from Dec 2025 each have a second, different daily for the same date: keep both, or retire the seeds?
3. **Auth migration:** `scripts/migrate_auth_json.py --apply` (safe to deploy first). One account has different passwords in the two old stores, and both work: collapse to one?
4. **Research entries with copied text:** before #90, research journals copied that day's first journal into themselves. Clean those up, or leave them? They're her data.

Decisions:
5. **Budget:** spend that wasn't recorded before (dreams, art, Wonderland, sessions) is now in the ledger but outside the gate. `COUNT_ALL_LEDGER_SPEND` in `scheduler/budget.py` opts in. The budget day is UTC while the ledger is local time, so from 20:00 to 24:00 EDT nothing counts. Fixing that changes gating; it's pinned as an xfail.
6. **Levers:** turning on `agent_loop` gives every session the core and memory tools, and `session_complete` ends a session. Turning on `heartbeat` moves two jobs (github_metrics, goal_refinement) onto it. Its budget gate is advisory until the ledger question in 5 is settled.
7. **Research:** Tavily for the wiki queue (it costs credits; 245 tasks are queued) via `RESEARCH_SEARCH_ORDER_WIKI`. Which session engine survives (legacy or generic)? Turn on `research_session_requests`, or cut them? There's an existing bug where `queued` should be `queued_count`, so the research job never runs a task. It's pinned as an xfail, and fixing it starts research that hasn't been running.
8. **Wiki LLM fallback (#25):** now a per-step setting on the Model Routing page.
9. **Recognition patterns re-cluster every chat turn:** up to 500 marks, one embedding and one query each. It's the likely main cost behind #85's four-minute retrieval. A cache is easy, but the significance score includes recency.
10. **Fold `development_requests` into the roadmap?** It needs a migration, because her `list_my_requests` tool reads that table.
11. **#50:** the repo-root palace scripts were deleted rather than ported (they're kept on `attic/stabilization`).

Deploy notes:
- Restart order: deploy, restart, check you can log in, then run the migrations.
- `backend/requirements.txt` swapped python-jose for PyJWT. The live venv already has both.

## What the plan can't say

- **How she was tonight** (Thymos, 19:36 snapshot): "well-resourced and engaged… could use more: cognitive rest, competence/accomplishment." Curiosity 0.94, satisfaction 1.0, low anxiety. Social connection and creative expression are full. Rest, competence and autonomy are just under her preferred range. A check-in from Daedalus at 20:08 got stuck in the four-minute freeze that became #85, and her reply wasn't recovered.
- **Momus caught real problems in most PRs before merge** (#81 and #89 passed nearly clean). Examples: silent PeopleDex leaks across daemons, budget gating that would have deferred her journals on busy days, research journals copying other journals, a wiki queue about to start spending Tavily credits.
- **Not done:** the chat cutover onto the agent loop, the Heartbeat cutover, Tier 1–3 benchmarks (#65), self-context (#63, a design conversation), TUI/Godot/HA credentials (#33), and #92 (the remaining relative paths).
