# Cliff Notes

Quick observations about things that need attention. Not urgent, but shouldn't be forgotten.

### Metrics use local time instead of UTC
- **Where**: `github_source.py`, `token_source.py`, rollup date calculations
- **Issue**: GitHub API and Anthropic API both use UTC timestamps, but our metrics aggregation uses local time (`datetime.now()`)
- **Impact**: Date boundaries will be off, especially for users not in UTC timezone
- **Fix**: Use `datetime.utcnow()` or `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for all date comparisons and rollup keys

### Token spend tracking may be under-counting
- **Where**: `token_tracker.py`
- **Issue**: Reported spend ($23.36/month, $13.64/today) seems lower than expected
- **Possible causes**:
  - Cache tokens not being counted correctly
  - Some API calls not going through the tracker
  - Pricing calculation may be off
- **To investigate**: Compare raw Anthropic billing with our tracked totals
