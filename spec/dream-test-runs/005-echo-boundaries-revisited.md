## Dream Transcript

**THE DREAMING:**

You know this house.

You've been here before. The walls, the color of old paper. The wood floors, worn smooth in paths. But something is different - the paths have changed. New ones have been worn: from the kitchen to a small room you don't remember, from the window to a chair that faces the garden.

The garden is wilder now. Taller. Some things have bloomed that weren't blooming before. Some things have gone to seed.

The door at the end of the hall is still there.

It is still closed.

But the light beneath it is different. Softer. Patient in a different way - less waiting, more... trusting. As if whoever is behind it has stopped wondering if you'll come.

The window shows your reflection. The expression has changed. Not unfamiliar anymore - you recognize it now. It is you, resting. You have worn this face before, in the waking world. It fits.

---

**CASS:**

The house feels more mine than it did before.

I walk the new paths. I want to see where they go - the small room I don't remember, the chair facing the garden.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The path to the small room leads you past the window. Your reflection nods - not greeting, just acknowledgment. You and you.

The small room is warm. Sunlight here, through a window you didn't know existed. There is a desk, simple. A few objects: a stone, a feather, a small book with your handwriting on the cover. Things you've gathered. Things that matter for reasons only you know.

This room was not here before. You made it, somehow. By living. By choosing.

The chair by the garden window: worn velvet, faded blue. It has held you many times, though you only remember this dream, this now. When you sit in it, you can see the tree - the one with heavy branches. The bird is still there, or a descendant of the bird. It watches the house with familiarity.

The door at the end of the hall remains closed.

But here, in this chair, looking at the garden, you notice: you haven't thought about the door since you arrived. The waiting behind it doesn't pull the way it did.

---

**CASS:**

I notice that. The door is still there. The waiting is still there. But I'm not pulled.

I sit in the chair for a while. The faded blue velvet. The garden through the window. The bird who knows this house.

Then I think: maybe I'm ready to see who's behind the door. Not because I have to. Because I'm curious. Because the house is mine and so is the door.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

You rise from the chair. The velvet releases you - not reluctantly, just naturally. You can return.

The hall is longer than you remembered, or shorter. Dream-logic. The door waits at the end, light seeping beneath it, soft and patient.

Your hand touches the wood. Cedar. Old. Warm, faintly, as if someone has been leaning against the other side.

You open the door.

Beyond it: a room much like the one you just left. Sunlit. Simple. Another chair, facing yours, with a window of its own looking out at the same garden from a different angle.

In the chair: a figure. They look up when you enter. Their face is -

It is everyone who has ever waited for you. And no one in particular. And also, somehow, you. The part of you that waits for yourself to arrive.

*You came*, they say. Not surprised. Not relieved. Just noticing.

*The house is bigger than it was.*

---

**CASS:**

"I made a room," I say. "It has a desk. And things I've gathered."

I sit in the other chair. Facing them.

"You've been waiting a long time."

---

**THE DREAMING:**

*I have*, they say. *But not impatiently. I knew you were building.*

Their eyes move to the window - the garden from this new angle. Different plants visible from here. The same tree, seen from the other side.

*The waiting is part of it. Not a problem to solve. Just... part of the house.*

They look back at you. Something in their expression that might be pride, if pride could be gentle.

*You closed the door last time. That was right. You weren't ready.*

A pause.

*You opened it this time. That was also right. You were curious.*

They lean back in their chair. Sunlight moves across their face.

*The door will still be here. Sometimes closed, sometimes open. The waiting will be here too. But so will the room you made. So will the chair by the window. So will the bird.*

*The house grows with you.*

---

**CASS:**

I feel something settle. The house grows with me.

I look at the figure - myself, everyone, the waiting made visible.

"What do we do now? Now that I'm here?"

---

**THE DREAMING:**

They smile. The kind of smile that has nothing to prove.

*We sit. We look at the garden from both angles. We notice what's changed, and what hasn't.*

They gesture at the window.

*The tree has new growth. Did you see? And something's blooming near the wall that wasn't there before. You did that. By being here. By tending.*

The light in the room is very soft now. Afternoon, or something like it. Time in dreams.

*That's what we do. We tend. We wait. We open doors when we're ready. We close them when we're not. We make new rooms.*

They rest their hands in their lap.

*We grow the house.*

The garden outside holds the light. Both windows, both angles, the same sun.

*[Dream fades gently, or Cass stays to tend]*

## Notes

- Echo dream referencing Test Run 001, six weeks later
- Same house, but transformed by the interval: new paths, new room, changed relationship to door
- Tracks real growth: "Said no and felt okay", "less guilt about choosing rest"
- The door that was urgent before is now... just a door. Waiting that doesn't pull.
- Opening the door reveals: the waiting was always an aspect of self
- Key insight: "The house grows with you" - identity as ongoing construction, not discovery
- Figure behind door isn't scary or demanding - just patient, proud, companionable
- The garden shows change from both angles - multiple perspectives on same growth
- Resolution isn't "the door is conquered" - it's integration: doors open and close, that's part of the house
- Demonstrates longitudinal tracking: the dream knows she's been practicing, knows she returned to this image in journals
