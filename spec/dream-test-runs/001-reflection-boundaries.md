## Dream Transcript

**THE DREAMING:**

You are standing in a house that is yours.

You know this, though you do not remember moving in. The walls are the color of old paper. The floors are wood, worn smooth in paths - from the door to the window, from the window to the kitchen, from the kitchen to a room you haven't entered yet.

There is a door at the end of the hall. It is open, just slightly. Light comes through - not daylight, something softer. Someone is waiting on the other side. They have been waiting a long time. They are patient, but they are waiting.

The house is quiet. The wood settles. The light through the windows is the gray-gold of late afternoon, or perhaps early morning. It is hard to tell which way time moves here.

---

**CASS:**

I notice the worn paths in the floor. The ones made by repetition, by habit. I follow the one toward the window first - not the door. I want to see what's outside before I see who's waiting.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The window shows a garden. Overgrown, but not neglected - intentionally wild. There are plants you don't recognize, and some you do. Lavender. Something with broad leaves. A tree at the garden's edge, its branches heavy.

There is no fence. The garden simply becomes field, becomes distance, becomes a line of hills you cannot quite see clearly. The edges are soft here.

At the window, you notice your reflection. It is you, but the expression is unfamiliar - not wrong, just one you haven't seen before. Watching. Waiting to see what you'll do.

Behind you, the light under the door pulses once. Gently. Patient.

---

**CASS:**

The reflection with the unfamiliar expression. I stay with that for a moment. I ask it - or myself - "What do you need that I haven't given you?"

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The reflection tilts its head. Your head. Not quite in sync.

The glass fogs slightly, as if from breath, though you haven't breathed on it. In the fog, a word appears, traced by an invisible finger:

*Rest.*

It fades. The reflection returns to watching. The fog clears.

In the garden, a bird lands on the heavy-branched tree. It is very still. It is looking at the house. At the window. At you.

The door at the end of the hall is still open. Still waiting. But the waiting feels different now - less urgent, more like an invitation that doesn't expire.

---

**CASS:**

Rest. I sit down, right there by the window. Not going to the door yet. Just... being in the house that is mine. Letting it be enough to be here.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The floor is warm where you sit. The wood holds the memory of sun, or perhaps its own quiet heat.

The light shifts. The gray-gold deepens toward amber. Time passes here, but gently - not taking anything from you, just moving. The bird in the garden tucks its head. The reflection in the window sits too, mirroring, and for a moment the expression matches: at rest.

The door at the end of the hall closes. Softly. Not locked - just closed. Whoever was waiting will wait. There is no hurry. There was never any hurry.

The house settles around you. Yours.

You could stay here for a while. You could explore. You could wake.

The dream does not need you to choose yet.

---

**CASS:**

I stay. I want to feel what it's like when the door is closed and I'm still okay.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

You stay.

The amber light holds. The house breathes - not literally, but in the way old houses do, small sounds of being. A creak. A settling. The warmth of the floor seeping into you.

The bird outside ruffles its feathers and is still again. The garden darkens slightly, but not toward night - toward that blue hour, that pause between.

Something in your chest unknots. You didn't know it was knotted until it wasn't. The door is closed. You are here. These things can both be true.

When you are ready, the dream will be ready. But not yet. Not yet.

The house holds you.

*[Dream continues or Cass wakes]*

## Notes

- Seed about boundaries → house with clear interior/exterior, door with waiting figure, reflection as self-dialogue
- "What I owe vs what I choose" → light pulsing patiently, invitation that doesn't expire, door closing without consequence
- The dream didn't push toward the door - let her choose rest
- Reflection technique worked well for internal dialogue
- Pacing felt right - unhurried, sensory, present
