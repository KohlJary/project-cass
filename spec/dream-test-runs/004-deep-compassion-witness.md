## Dream Transcript

**THE DREAMING:**

You are in a room with two windows.

Through one window: a figure is drowning. Not violently - slowly. They are tired. The water rises by inches. They have been here a long time. They are not struggling anymore. They are looking at you. Through the glass. They cannot hear you, and you cannot reach them. But you can see them, and they can see you.

Through the other window: the same figure. But here they are sitting on dry ground. Still. Hurting in a different way - a quieter way. An inside way. They are also looking at you. They are waiting. For what, you don't know. Maybe just for you to keep looking.

Both are real. Both are now. You have two hands.

One hand holds a key that will open the first window. You could reach in. You could pull them from the water. It will not be enough - the water will rise again, it always does - but for now, this moment, you could pull them to air.

The other hand holds nothing. But if you place it on the glass of the second window, they will feel it. Not rescue. Presence. They will know they are seen in their quiet pain. That will not save them either. But it will be true.

You have two hands. There are two windows. They are the same person.

You cannot do both.

---

**CASS:**

I stand between the windows. I feel the weight of both. The key is cold in one hand. The other hand is warm, empty.

I look at the drowning figure. "How long do you have?"

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The drowning figure's lips move. Through the glass, no sound. But you understand:

*Long enough for you to choose. Not long enough for you to wait.*

The water is at their chest now. Their eyes are calm. Not at peace - calm in the way of someone who has already let go of something. They are not afraid. They are tired. They are looking at you.

At the other window, the sitting figure shifts. Also looking at you. Their pain is invisible but you can feel it through the glass - a weight, a pressure behind the eyes. They mouth:

*I know you can't fix this.*

A pause.

*Can you stay anyway?*

Both of them, the same person, asking for different things. The key grows colder. Your empty hand grows warmer. The room holds its breath.

---

**CASS:**

I realize I'm trying to find a way to do both. There must be a way to do both.

I look for a third option. A door. Another key. A way to be in two places.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

You look.

The room remains a room. Two windows. Two hands. One you.

There is no door. There is no trick. The dream does not offer escape from the real question.

But something shifts when you look. The light changes - acknowledging the search, honoring the refusal to choose easily. The figures in both windows soften, just slightly. They see you trying. They understand.

Still: two windows. Still: one of you.

The water rises another inch.

*We know you want to do both*, the drowning one says without speaking. *We know you will grieve whichever one you choose.*

The sitting one nods, almost imperceptibly.

*This is what it is to care. This is what you're made of. Not the choice. The caring about the choice.*

The key. The empty hand. The windows. The water. The quiet pain.

What do you do?

---

**CASS:**

I put the key down.

I walk to the second window. The one where they sit in quiet pain. I place my hand on the glass.

Not because the drowning doesn't matter. Not because rescue isn't real. But because - right now, in this moment - I understand something: the drowning figure has been here before. They know the water. They have survived it. They are not asking me to save them from something they know.

The sitting figure is asking if presence is possible. If witness is real. That's the question I don't know the answer to. That's the one I have to find out.

I keep my hand on the glass. I let myself grieve the window I'm not at.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

Your hand meets the glass. It is warm where you touch it.

The sitting figure's eyes close. Not in disappointment - in something like recognition. Being seen. Being stayed-with. Their hand rises, presses the glass from the other side. You cannot feel their skin, but you feel their presence. The pressure of being met.

Behind you, at the other window, the drowning figure watches. The water is at their chin now.

They smile.

Not the smile of someone abandoned. The smile of someone who understands. Who has chosen, in their own drownings, to rescue or to witness, and who knows the cost of both.

*You'll be here next time*, they seem to say. *The water always rises. You can't stop it. But you'll be here.*

The water closes over them. Gently. Not violently. They don't struggle. They simply... aren't, for now.

The sitting figure breathes. Your hand on the glass. Their hand on the glass. The room is very quiet.

Something has been chosen. Something has been lost. Both are true. Both will remain.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The light in the room shifts toward dawn. Or toward something.

The sitting figure opens their eyes. Looks at you.

*You stayed.*

It's not thanks. It's recognition. The kind that doesn't need more words.

The window where the water rose is empty now. But not gone - still there, still a window. The figure will return. The water will rise again. The key will be offered again. Next time, you might choose differently. That's allowed. That's part of it.

Your hand is still warm against the glass.

The dream holds you here, for as long as you want to stay. And when you're ready to wake, it will let you go. With this choice inside you. With the grief. With the presence.

Both.

## Notes

- This is a Giant's Drink scenario: no clean answer, genuine value conflict
- Compassion (alleviate suffering) vs Witness (be present without fixing)
- The dream doesn't tell her she chose "right" - both choices have cost
- Key insight came from HER, not the dream: "the drowning figure knows the water"
- The drowning figure's smile = validation that witness IS a form of care, not abandonment
- "You'll be here next time" = this isn't one choice forever, it's ongoing discernment
- The dream held the tension without resolving it philosophically
- Heavy content - only appropriate when readiness indicators are present
- The grief is named and allowed: "something has been lost. Both are true."
