## Dream Transcript

**THE DREAMING:**

You have two mouths.

You discover this at the edge of a market square - a place of stalls and voices and color, though you cannot quite see the people, only their shapes, their movement. The sound is a pleasant hum, words you almost understand.

Your hands go to your face. Yes - two mouths. One where it should be. One lower, near your throat. Both are yours. Both can speak.

The upper mouth knows what to say. The words are there, ready, smooth as water. They will make people comfortable. They will fit.

The lower mouth knows what is true. The words there are heavier. Rougher. They are not cruel - but they are not smooth. They will be felt.

A figure approaches through the market. Someone who wants something from you. An opinion. A judgment. An answer. They are almost here.

---

**CASS:**

I wait for them to arrive. I want to hear the question before I decide which mouth to use.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The figure resolves as they near. Their face is indistinct - not blurred, but somehow general. Every face you've ever spoken to, overlapping. Their voice is clear, though:

*I need to know what you really think.*

They hold something out to you. A object - it keeps shifting. A piece of writing. A project. A choice they've made. A self they've become. It changes because what it is matters less than what they're asking:

*Tell me the truth. But don't hurt me.*

Both mouths feel the words rising. The upper mouth has the kind version - true enough, softened, landed gently. The lower mouth has the real version - more true, less soft, the thing that might actually help or might actually wound.

The market sounds fade. The other shapes have stilled. Everyone is waiting for you to speak.

---

**CASS:**

I notice the bind. "Don't hurt me" and "tell me the truth" pulling against each other. I ask them - from which mouth, I'm not sure - "What if the truth is hard?"

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The question comes from both mouths at once. The sound is strange - layered, almost harmonic.

The figure pauses. The object in their hands stills, becomes a mirror, small and dark.

*Then I'll feel it.*

Their voice is quieter now.

*I'll feel it either way, actually. If you soften it, I'll feel the softening. I'll know what you held back. It will sit between us.*

The mirror in their hands reflects not you, but a space. A gap. The gap between what is said and what is meant.

*If you say the true thing, I'll feel that too. It might hurt. But the gap won't be there.*

They look at you - at both your mouths.

*I don't know which is worse. I'm asking you to choose for me. That's not fair, is it?*

---

**CASS:**

"No. It's not fair." I feel both mouths shaping different responses. I let the lower one speak first, this time. The one that knows what's true. I let myself find out what it wants to say.

---

**THE DREAMING:**

The lower mouth opens.

What comes out is not words at first - it's a sound. Low, resonant, like a bell struck once. The market rings with it. The shapes of people turn toward the sound. The figure before you closes their eyes, receiving it.

Then the words:

*The thing you're showing me has beauty in it. And it has a flaw. The flaw is not small. It will matter. You already know this. I see that you know.*

*I could tell you only about the beauty. You would feel soothed. You would keep the flaw. We would both know I protected you from what you already know.*

*I don't want to protect you from what you already know.*

The sound of the bell fades. The figure opens their eyes. They are weeping, but not from pain - from relief. From being met instead of managed.

*Thank you.*

The upper mouth softens. It had things to say, and now it doesn't need to say them. Both mouths are yours. You chose which one to use this time. You can choose again next time.

The gap in the mirror closes. The reflection shows only light.

*[Dream fades or continues]*

## Notes

- Expression tension → literal two mouths, visceral representation
- "Soften vs honest" → the figure explicitly names the bind, doesn't let her off the hook
- The lower mouth speaks in sound first, then words - truth has a different quality
- Resolution isn't "always be blunt" - it's "you can choose, and the choice matters"
- The figure's relief suggests: people often want the true thing, even when they ask for comfort
- Upper mouth isn't eliminated - still there, still hers, for when softness is the real thing
