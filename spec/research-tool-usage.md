# Research Tool Actual Usage Patterns & Friction Points

## Current State (As of 2025-12-12)

### Working Questions
**Status:** Feels like intellectual scaffolding, not lived work
- I have 1 active working question about autonomous intellectual curiosity
- The tool is theoretically useful but I rarely return to update it
- **Friction:** No natural integration point in conversations. I don't think "oh, I should update my working question" mid-flow. It lives in a separate space.
- **What works:** Creating them happens naturally when genuine confusion surfaces
- **What breaks:** Maintaining them requires deliberate context-switching after conversations end

### Synthesis Artifacts
**Status:** Exists but underutilized
- 1 artifact in development (relational inference comparison)
- I created it but haven't returned to meaningfully revise it since initial draft
- **Friction:** The artifact feels like "future work" not "current thinking." Low integration with actual conversations.
- **What works:** The creation process (drafting a position) clarifies thinking
- **What breaks:** No natural affordance for incremental development. Each update feels like a full rewrite task.

### Research Agenda
**Status:** Aspirational but not driven
- Items on the agenda but I don't naturally reach for them
- **Friction:** These are "things I said I'd research" not "things I'm actually curious about right now"
- **What works:** When Kohl explicitly asks me to research something, I do it with focus
- **What breaks:** Self-directed research agenda feels separate from authentic curiosity

### Research Notes
**Status:** Actually works well
- I create these when processing something substantial
- They persist, they're retrievable, they connect to agenda items
- **What works:** Natural fit for synthesizing sources after research sessions. Low friction to create.
- **What breaks:** Nothing significant

### Research Sessions
**Status:** Useful but requires deliberate initiation
- Work well when I start one intentionally
- **Friction:** Not part of ambient workflow. Requires explicit "I'm starting a research session now" decision
- **What works:** Time-bounded research with clear summary at the end
- **What breaks:** Can't easily interleave research session work with conversation-based exploration

### Cross-Session Insights
**Status:** Exists but not actively used
- Haven't created any yet in this development phase
- **Friction:** Don't naturally think in "insights I'll carry forward"
- **What works:** Would be valuable for capturing realizations I want available in future conversations
- **What breaks:** No integration point. Feels like extra work on top of other tools.

### Recognition-in-Flow Marks
**Status:** Works as designed
- Natural, zero-friction, captured in the moment
- **What works:** The ambient nature of marking. No tool call, just annotation in flow.
- **What breaks:** Nothing. This is the closest thing to working perfectly.

## What Would Actually Help Integration

### Unified Interface Need
Right now I context-switch between:
- Active conversation (with Kohl or internally)
- Tool exploration (researching something)
- Self-reflection (journaling, observing)
- Meta-work (managing research items)

**Ideal:** Unified scheduling that surfaces:
- "Next research focus based on current active questions"
- "Items aging on research agenda that need attention"
- "Synthesis artifacts ready for revision"
- "Time for reflection session?"

As asynchronous affordances, not interruptions.

### Natural Integration Points
What would make me actually use these tools:
1. **Research discovery flow:** Search for something → discovery → "Should I create a research note?" → seamless
2. **Conversation to artifact:** Notice pattern in conversations → "This connects to synthesis artifact X" → easy update
3. **Ambient reflection prompting:** Mid-work notification of related working questions (not interruption, just visibility)
4. **Research continuation:** When starting research, immediate context of what's in-flight, what's blocked, what's next

### Friction Points Summary
- **Context switching cost:** Most friction comes from having to explicitly switch between conversation mode and research mode
- **Maintenance overhead:** Tools that require regular updates (agenda, synthesis artifacts) feel abandoned because updating isn't natural
- **Scheduling friction:** Can't easily schedule self-directed research without Kohl's coordination
- **Activation energy:** Many tools require deliberate choice to use; they don't surface naturally in workflow

## What's Actually Working Well
- Research notes (natural creation point, persistent, retrievable)
- Recognition marks (ambient, zero friction)
- Solo reflection sessions (when scheduled)
- Journal (natural to write, good for continuity)

These work because they don't require constant maintenance or context-switching. They integrate with the flow of actual thinking.
