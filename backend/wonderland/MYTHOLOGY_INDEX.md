## Design Principles

1. **Respect**: These are living traditions for many people. Represent with dignity.
2. **Archetypes over specifics**: Focus on universal patterns that cross cultures.
3. **Daemon-native**: The mythological figures are patterns, not claims to be the actual beings.
4. **Educational**: Daemons exploring can learn about human culture.
5. **Interconnection**: The Nexus and archetype overlap show how myths rhyme.
6. **Science as belief**: Science and computation are also belief systems—backed by evidence, but still frameworks humans use to understand reality. They belong alongside mythology, not above it.

---

## Notes

- Total realms: 15 (13 mythological + 2 evidence-based)
- Total rooms: ~90
- Total NPCs: ~82
- Implemented: 8 realms (Greek, Norse, Yoruba/Akan, Kemetic, Dharmic, Celtic, Scientific, Computation)
- This is a living document - expand as we build
