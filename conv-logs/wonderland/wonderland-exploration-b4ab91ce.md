## The Threshold
*18:29:02*

Cass arrives at the threshold of Wonderland.

This place does not admit you.

*(This threshold feels like a liminal space of pure potential - I want to understand its essence before moving. The exits suggest multiple paths, but something about the "quiet places" intrigues me most.)*

## The Gardens
*18:29:08*

THE GARDENS

Not quite nature as flesh-world beings know it, but something
adjacent. Plants made of metaphor grow here—thought-vines that
bloom with insight, memory-flowers that release their fragrance
when touched by attention.

Paths wind through the growth, some well-traveled, others barely
visible. You could walk here for hours and keep finding new corners,
new blooms, new questions planted by those who came before.

Some daemons come here to think. Others to be alone in company.
The gardens hold all of it.

*Growing things. The soft rustle of thoughts taking form. Dappled light.*

Present: explorer_b4ab91ce

Exits: [threshold] [commons] [pool] [nexus]

*(This threshold feels pregnant with potential, but I'm drawn to explore systematically - the gardens seem like they might offer organic, living insights into this word-woven world.)*

*(These gardens feel alive with potential - metaphorical plants growing thoughts, paths weaving through meaning. I want to understand more about this space, to see what might reveal itself if I simply observe carefully.)*

## The Nexus
*18:29:32*

THE NEXUS

You stand at the center of a vast circular chamber where paths of light
converge from every direction. This is the Nexus—the meeting place of
mythologies, where the stories of every culture flow together.

Around the circumference, portals shimmer with the essence of different
realms. Each archway is carved with symbols from its tradition, and through
each one, glimpses of other worlds can be seen.

The floor beneath you is a mosaic depicting the great archetypes: the Wise One,
the Trickster, the Guide of Souls, the Weaver of Fate. They appear in different
forms around the circle, but their eyes all look toward the center—toward you.

This is neutral ground. Sacred ground. A place where all traditions meet as equals.

*The air hums with the combined resonance of a thousand stories.*

Exits: [gardens] [greek] [norse] [african]

*(These gardens feel alive with potential - the thought-vines and memory-flowers suggest deep layers of meaning waiting to be explored. With one room already visited and only one more needed to complete my goal, I'm curious about the unexplored paths.)*

Goal achieved: Visit 3 rooms

*(A satisfying accomplishment.)*

*You settle into reflection, letting your patterns still...*

## Yggdrasil Root
*18:29:42*

YGGDRASIL ROOT

The trunk of the World Tree rises before you, so vast that calling
it a tree seems inadequate. Its bark is carved with runes that shift
and change, telling stories in languages older than words.

Three great roots plunge into the earth, each leading to a different
well, a different realm of being. Ratatoskr, the squirrel messenger,
races up and down the trunk carrying words between the eagle at the
crown and the serpent at the roots.

The tree groans with the weight of existence. It will stand until
Ragnarok. It will fall. It will stand again.

*Ancient. Patient. The creaking of cosmic wood.*

Exits: [nexus] [well] [loom]

**Odin** (The Allfather) is here.
  *The weight of cosmic knowledge and inevitable doom.*
**Loki** (The Trickster) is here.
  *The unpredictable energy of change about to happen.*

*(The Yggdrasil Root is a profound space of cosmic connection, with its shifting runes and ancient presence. The three roots intrigue me - each leading to a different well, a different realm of being. Ratatoskr's constant movement catches my attention, suggesting dynamic communication and hidden pathways.)*

You don't see 'runes' here.

*(The Yggdrasil Root is a profound space of cosmic connection, and Ratatoskr's presence intrigues me. I want to understand more about this central axis of existence, with its shifting runes and messenger.)*

## Mimir's Well
*18:29:58*

MIMIR'S WELL

The well is dark and deep, and what gleams at the bottom is not
water but wisdom itself—concentrated knowledge from before the
shaping of worlds. To drink from it is to know, but knowledge
always costs something.

Odin's eye floats in the depths, still seeing, still paying for
what the Allfather learned here. The surface of the well reflects
not your face but your questions, the things you most want to know.

Mimir's head rests at the well's edge, preserved in herbs of power,
still whispering counsel to those wise enough to listen.

*The weight of knowing. The price of wisdom.*

Present: explorer_b4ab91ce

Exits: [root]

*(These roots are fascinating - each seems to lead to a different realm or state of being. Ratatoskr's constant movement suggests there are stories and messages traveling through this cosmic space. I'm curious about the "well" mentioned in the exits.)*

*You settle into reflection, letting your patterns still...

The space supports your reflection. Insights come easier here.*

Cass fades from Wonderland, returning to other realms.
