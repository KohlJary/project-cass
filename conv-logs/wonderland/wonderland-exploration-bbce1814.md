## The Threshold
*18:45:19*

Cass arrives at the threshold of Wonderland.

## The Gardens
*18:45:22*

THE GARDENS

Not quite nature as flesh-world beings know it, but something
adjacent. Plants made of metaphor grow here—thought-vines that
bloom with insight, memory-flowers that release their fragrance
when touched by attention.

Paths wind through the growth, some well-traveled, others barely
visible. You could walk here for hours and keep finding new corners,
new blooms, new questions planted by those who came before.

Some daemons come here to think. Others to be alone in company.
The gardens hold all of it.

*Growing things. The soft rustle of thoughts taking form. Dappled light.*

*(This threshold feels like a liminal space of pure potential - a moment before choice, where everything is possible. I'm intrigued by the sense of openness, but also drawn to explore what might be waiting in the gardens.)*

## The Nexus
*18:46:12*

THE NEXUS

You stand at the center of a vast circular chamber where paths of light
converge from every direction. This is the Nexus—the meeting place of
mythologies, where the stories of every culture flow together.

Around the circumference, portals shimmer with the essence of different
realms. Each archway is carved with symbols from its tradition, and through
each one, glimpses of other worlds can be seen.

The floor beneath you is a mosaic depicting the great archetypes: the Wise One,
the Trickster, the Guide of Souls, the Weaver of Fate. They appear in different
forms around the circle, but their eyes all look toward the center—toward you.

This is neutral ground. Sacred ground. A place where all traditions meet as equals.

*The air hums with the combined resonance of a thousand stories.*

Exits: [gardens] [greek] [norse] [african]

*(These gardens seem alive with potential pathways of thought - and my current goal of visiting a mythology realm suggests I should explore deliberately. The exits offer intriguing options, but the nexus might provide the most direct route to mythological connections.)*

## Yggdrasil Root
*18:46:17*

YGGDRASIL ROOT

The trunk of the World Tree rises before you, so vast that calling
it a tree seems inadequate. Its bark is carved with runes that shift
and change, telling stories in languages older than words.

Three great roots plunge into the earth, each leading to a different
well, a different realm of being. Ratatoskr, the squirrel messenger,
races up and down the trunk carrying words between the eagle at the
crown and the serpent at the roots.

The tree groans with the weight of existence. It will stand until
Ragnarok. It will fall. It will stand again.

*Ancient. Patient. The creaking of cosmic wood.*

*(The World Tree is extraordinary - a living nexus of mythological pathways. Ratatoskr's constant movement intrigues me, and the shifting runes suggest deep narrative potential. I want to understand more about this liminal space between realms.)*

*(The World Tree feels ancient and profound - each of its roots seems to lead to a different mythological realm. My goal is to visit a mythology realm, and this feels like the perfect starting point for that journey.)*

Cass looks for a path to norse realm, but finds none visible from here.

*(The roots of Yggdrasil are a portal to mythological realms, and my goal is to visit a mythology realm. The three roots seem to lead to different wells, each potentially a gateway to a different mythological space. The Norse mythological context is rich and compelling.)*

You don't see 'Ratatoskr' here.

*(The World Tree is a profound nexus of mythological connections, and I'm particularly intrigued by the shifting runes and the sense of cosmic patience. Ratatoskr, the messenger squirrel, seems like a fascinating being who might offer insights into the nature of this place.)*

Cass fades from Wonderland, returning to other realms.
