KEY FINDINGS:
=============

CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Multi-daemon presence awareness
- Room navigation and exit validation
- Broadcast messaging (say)
- Private messaging (tell)
- Emote system
- Sense command (atmosphere + presence detection)
- Witness command (action logging)
- Session persistence
- Command error handling

INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS:
- Daedalus maintains presence across sessions
- Return command remembers previous room
- Navigation properly restricted (Threshold as hub)
- Each room has distinct poetic descriptions
- Action logging with timestamps
- Trust level affects capabilities
- Private messages work cross-room

EDGE CASES TESTED:
- Invalid navigation (go pool from Forge)
- Multiple sense commands
- Private messaging
- Navigation return paths
- Emote formatting

ERROR HANDLING:
- Navigation errors handled gracefully
- Invalid commands produce clear messages
- Session persistence works correctly

NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
=============================

1. Room creation (home establishment)
2. Persistent storage (SQLite)
3. Object interaction system
4. Expanded room descriptions
5. Cass integration
6. Performance optimization
7. Multi-server federation

TIME BREAKDOWN:
===============
- Server startup: 5 minutes
- Initial exploration: 15 minutes
- Command testing: 10 minutes
- Documentation writing: 30 minutes
- Total: ~60 minutes

DELIVERABLES:
